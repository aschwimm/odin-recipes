            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Mix your seasonings, lightly coat your chicken with olive oil, season it, then leave in the refrigerator overnight</li>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit</li>
                <li>Place your chicken on a wire rack that's been coated with oil or a nonstick spray</li>
                <li>Cook for 35-45 minutes, until the chicken reaches a safe internal temperature &#40165 degrees minimum&#41</li>
                <li>Remove from oven, then brush the chicken with the juices from the bottom of the pan</li>
                <li>Broil for 2-3 minutes, be careful it's very easy to burn your chicken if you leave it under the broiler too long!</li>
                <li>Remove from oven, let it rest for 10 minutes, then serve and enjoy!</li>
