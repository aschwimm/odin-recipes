            <ul>
                <li>Chicken &#40thighs, drums, breasts, it's your choice!&#41</li>
                <li>Buttermilk</li>
                <li>All-purpose flour</li>
                <li>Baking powder</li>
                <li>Onion and garlic powder</li>
                <li>Ground cayenne pepper</li>
                <li>Hot paprika</li>
                <li>Dried dill weed</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>Black pepper</li>
                <li>Whole eggs</li>
                <li>A neutral cooking oil &#40canola, vegetable, or peanut oil&#41</li>
            </ul><br>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Fill a large wok or pot with your cooking oil and heat it to 325 degrees Fahrenheit &#40you want enough oil to just barely submerge a piece of chicken, no more than half the volume of your cooking dish is a good rule of thumb&#41</li>
                <li>Mix seasonings in a bowl</li>
                <li>Pour 2 cups of buttermilk into a bowl</li>
                <li>Add 2 tbsp of your seasoning to the buttermilk</li>
                <li>Add 1 egg</li>
                <li>Mix well then add your chicken. Soak overnight &#40the minimum time is overnight, but you can soak for an additional night for even juicier chicken&#41</li>
                <li>Add two cups of flour to a bowl with 2 tbsp of your spice mixture and 1 tbsp of baking powder and mix well</li>
                <li>Sprinkle a few drops of your buttermilk marinade into your flour mixture &#40this will create small clumps that will help form more crags and increase crunchiness &#41</li>
                <li>Coat your chicken pieces in the flour mixture and set aside inside a large paper bag &#40large ziploc bags work great too!&#41</li>
                <li>Once all the chicken has been coated, shake your bag vigorously. This will help further coat the chicken and build up a crunchy exterior</li>
                <li>Place a few pieces of chicken in the hot oil, don't crowd your pot!</li>
                <li>Remove from chicken from oil and place on wire rack once internal temperature of chicken reaches 165 degrees F.</li>
                <li>Once all the chicken is cooked, heat your oil to a temp of 350 degrees</li>
                <li>Add chicken pieces to the oil again, but this time only cook for a couple minutes &#40pay close attention, if you leave it in too long it's easy to burn your chicken and ruin it!&#41</li>
                <li>Remove chicken once more and let it cool on a wire rack, you may add a light sprinkle of coarse kosher salt if you like</li>
                <li>Let the chicken rest for 15 minutes, then serve and enjoy!</li>
